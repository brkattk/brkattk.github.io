My name is Erik Straub. I'm a developer from upstate New York. I'm also a father, husband, and trained thrower for whatever my dog brings me. I currently work at Odd Networks on various software projects using various different technologies such as Node.JS, Elixir, Go, and Kotlin. When I'm not behind a screen, I like to be outdoors hiking, biking, kayaking, and generally enjoying what the Adirondacks have to offer.
